        and calm design so I opted for colors that are soft and lime-ish green

        I'm a versatile developer, on the frontend I use react with typescript
        to build complex products/features, but could also use either angular or
        vue. On the backend, I have built apps using Ruby On Rails, Firebase and
        NodeJS &lt;3. I also am a big fan of UX design, really like making
        well-designed and purpose-driven websites.
